			<p>
				We are storing data about owner in database. The application is allowing only one owner to be stored and to be saved successfully from GUI all parameters except note
				(name, address, ico, dic, bank, note, email, telephone) must be filled and in valid format. To test formating we are using regular expressions on every input and unless
				the regular expression returns true on all tested parameters saving data is not possible.
				His/her expansions and earnings are represented by transaction with entity and type of transaction (buying/selling).
