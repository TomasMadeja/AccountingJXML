				<p>Assignment:
					Student are to design and develop Java application for recording income and spending of small business owner, that stores data
					in fitting format within native XML database. To this end, students are to design structure of XML data and describe it using XML schema.
				<ul>Functionality is to be capable of
					<li>new revenue</li>
					<li>adding new expenditure</li>
					<li>calculating gains/losses since the start of accounting period (year)</li>
					<li>exporting data in fitting format into PDF</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>Every store income will include the following information:
				<li>payer information</li>
				<li>recipient information</li>
				<li>date of issuing of the document</li>
				<li>billing date of the document</li>
				<li>list of invoiced items</li>
				</ul>
			</ul></p>

		<h1>Implementation</h1>
			<p>This application was programmed in Java with markup language XML to store application data as xml documents. For GUI we used library Swing.
				Whole graphical interface is created with .form file which is specific to IntelliJ IDEA and as such is necessary to build the project successfully.
				We have decided to use eXist-db because it is opensource xml database supporting XSLT and XQuery. Another important factor was high quality documentation.

		    This graph represents how are we working with every request. The request starts from user who is using our GUI.
			Next our GUI creates a request into functionality layer etc.
		<h1>GUI</h1>
			<p>
				Here is a demonstration of latest version of our GUI:

		<h1>XML database</h1>
			<p>
				We are storing data about owner in database. The application is allowing only one owner to be stored and to be saved successfully from GUI all parameters except note
				(name, address, ico, dic, bank, note, email, telephone) must be filled and in valid format. To test formating we are using regular expressions on every input and unless
				the regular expression returns true on all tested parameters saving data is not possible.
				His/her expansions and earnings are represented by transaction with entity and type of transaction (buying/selling).
