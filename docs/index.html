		<h1>Implementation</h1>
			<p>This application was programmed in Java with markup language XML to store application data as xml documents. For GUI we used library Swing.
				Whole graphical interface is created with .form file which is specific to IntelliJ IDEA and as such is necessary to build the project successfully.
				We have decided to use eXist-db because it is opensource xml database supporting XSLT and XQuery. Another important factor was high quality documentation.
			</p>
		<h1>GUI</h1>
			<p>
				Here is a demonstration of latest version of our GUI:

		<h1>XML database</h1>
			<p>
				We are storing data about owner in database. The application is allowing only one owner to be stored and to be saved successfully from GUI all parameters except note
				(name, address, ico, dic, bank, note, email, telephone) must be filled and in valid format. To test formating we are using regular expressions on every input and unless
				the regular expression returns true on all tested parameters saving data is not possible.
				His/her expansions and earnings are represented by transaction with entity and type of transaction (buying/selling).
